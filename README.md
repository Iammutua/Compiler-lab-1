# Lexer Implementation for Compiler Construction

This file explains the steps taken to implement a lexer for compiler construction. The lexer is implemented in two different environments: Python using Jupyter Notebooks and C using Flex specifications and the GCC compiler.

## Python Implementation with Jupyter Notebooks

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment

1. Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already.
2. Create a new Jupyter Notebook for your lexer implementation.

### Step 2: Define the Lexer

1. Define the lexer using Python's regular expressions and the `re` module.
2. Implement a function to tokenize the input text.
3. Test the lexer with sample input to ensure it correctly tokenizes the text.

### Step 3: Run the Jupyter Notebook

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute and test your lexer.
2. Ensure that the lexer produces the expected output for various input texts.
3. Document your code and provide explanations for each step.

### Step 4: Share or Export the Jupyter Notebook

1. Share the Jupyter Notebook with others or export it to different formats for presentation and documentation.

## C Implementation with Flex Specifications

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment

1. Install Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator) and GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) if you haven't already.
2. Create a new directory for your C lexer implementation.

### Step 2: Write Flex Specification

1. Create a Flex specification file (e.g., `lexer.l`) where you define the token patterns and corresponding actions.
2. Specify regular expressions for identifying tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, and operators.

### Step 3: Generate Lexer Code

1. Use the `flex` command to generate C code from your Flex specification file:

   ```bash
   flex lexer.l

2. This generates a file called `lex.yy.c`

### Step 4 : Compile the lexer

Compile the generated C code using GCC:

`gcc -o tokenizer lex.yy.c -lfl`
   This produces an executable called `tokenizer``

### Step 5 : Run the lexer

   ```bash
   ./tokenizer < input.txt
